# Xcode Playground Markup Snippets
Snippets for using in Xcode Playgrounds
* * * 
## How to use the playground markup snippets
* Copy the snippet files to the Custom code Snippets directory
* Restart Xcode
* Scroll through the Code Snippet library or enter a search term into the filter field. 
* Drag from the Code Snippet library to your code. That's it :smile:

## About Custom Code Snippets
* Custom code snippets are usually stored in the following location:
`/Users/YourUsername/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets`
* If you dont have a CodeSnippets directory, :confused:  its because you havent created any custom code snippets yet. (see below for how to create custom code snippets)
* Code snippet files have the extenion .codesnippet

## How to create custom Xcode code snippets
* Write some code youâ€™d like to reuse often. :loop:
* Select it by highlighting it in the editor
* Drag the selected/highlighted section into the Code Snippets library
* That's all. :tada: You now have a custom code snippet! :confetti_ball:
